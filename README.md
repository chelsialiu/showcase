INTRODUCTION
---------------
This semester, I decided to do a self-study course about full stack development. I found this great course online ("Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development") and have learned so much! This website was created to showcase the knowledge and skills I have attained.



COURSE NOTES
---------------
This course was pretty thorough and I took notes on practically EVERYTHING. Check out screenshots of the notes from each of the modules.



LESSONS LEARNED
---------------
I used to consider myself a "frontend developer", but this course helped me expand that to becoming more "fullstack". As such, there were a lot of things I learned and did for the first time during this full stack course. Check out the list of cool things!



TECH STACK AND ARCHITECTURE
---------------
Understanding how all the various elements of a full stack application work and interact was something I sought dilligently to understand. Creating a tech stack and architecture diagram helped solidify the "big picture" of how it all works together. React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database.



DEMO
---------------
Applying the concepts I learned in the course, I created my very own full stack application -- frontend, backend, and database! While it has very basic functionality, there are some pretty fascinating and powerful things happening behind the scenes.
